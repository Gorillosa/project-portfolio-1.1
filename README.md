# Portfolio – Project 1

I created this website to compile project to worked on my skills, training, and experience. It provides insight into my personality and working style. 
Users can use my website to familiarize with my work and get in contact with me. 

## UX
### Project Goals

To allow current and potential customers get to know my work and myself, and contact me once they decide to work with me. 

### User Stories

**As a user I want...**

-	To be able easily navigate through the website and find what I’m looking for
-	To be able to quickly send a message to the website owner
-	
**Wireframes**

I drew my [Wireframes](https://github.com/Gorillosa/project-portfolio-1.1/tree/main/Wireframes) in Paint, kept it very simple. 

 ## Features
- **Navigation Bar:** The navigation bar is always fixed to the top of the page, changing to the Toggle Menu on smaller screens. Thanks to that, menu is out of the way, so the contents only take up space when the user needs to see the full menu. 
- **Social media links:** Each link opens a new page with the relevant personal page on social media (Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub). These links make it easy for users to access my social media profiles from one place. The social media profiles load in a new tab, which allows users to then return to the site.
-**Contact Form:** Any visitor can easily contact me by filling out the form and submit it to send a message or enquiry. This also lets me get messages from visitors easily without revealing my email address to spammers.
- **Footer:** The Footer includes copyright information in regards to the site.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5**
-	The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my website.
**CSS3**
-	The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.
**Bootstrap v5.0**
-	The project uses Bootstrap v5.0 to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components and Bootstrap styles to my website, before adding my custom styles.
**Font Awesome**
-	The project uses Font Awesome for the social media links.
**Git**
-	I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project, before pushing them to GitHub.
**GitHub**
-	I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## Testing 
I used Mozilla Firefox Development tools to test changes that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. 
I also used [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to test my HTML and CSS code. 

# Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. I used the following steps to deploy my website to GitHub pages:

- Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
- Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the git `add .` command.
- Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
- Created a new repository in GitHub called 'portfolio-project-1.1'.
- Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my workspace:
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/Gorillosa/project-portfolio-1.1`
- `git push -u origin main`
- Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
- Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
- Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.
- Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
